# Shakespeare-Sonnet-Generator
Our goal in this projectis to build a Shakespeare Sonnet Generator. Given a prompt of a few words as input, its task is to generate follow-on text that reads like a Shakespeare Sonnet!

To build our Sonnet Generator we will use a type of model called a sequence model. Given a short sequence, a sequence model predicts the most likely next item in the sequence. Sequence models are astonishingly versatile and powerful, because the sequence we want to predict can be quite general! It can be composed of words, or of characters, or of musical notes, or of data points in a time series such as EKG voltages, or stock prices, or even a sequence of DNA nucleotides!
